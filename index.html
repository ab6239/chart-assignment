			<p class="intro">One would think that a higher number of public recycling bins would correlate to a higher recycling rate, but analysis from 2019 data shows that may not be the case.
			</p>
            <p class="intro">Brooklyn and Queens have recycling-to-bin ratios that appear to correspond. The Bronx's recycling rate is on the lower side in relation to the number of public recycling bins.

            <p class="intro">But Manhattan and Staten Island are the real outliers; Manhattan, which has the highest population density and the largest number of public recycling bins, is neck and neck with Staten Island when it comes to recycling rate. And Staten Island has the lowest population density and the smallest number of public recycling bins.

            <p class="intro">Dr. Marco Castaldi, a Chemical Engineering Professor at CCNY who studies advanced, or chemical, recycling, said the fault lies with the public.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p class="intro">"There are wastebaskets at every corner, almost. And there's garbage all over the street. Whose fault is this? ... Ours. So, because it's difficult to collect, it doesn't make it the fault of the plastic, it doesn't make it the fault of the manufacturer; to me it makes it the fault of the consumer," said Dr. Castaldi.
